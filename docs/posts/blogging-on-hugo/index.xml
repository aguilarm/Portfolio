      <description>This site is running Hugo with GitHub pages, and I am really happy with the setup. There are a lot of options for spinning up a personal blog site, and I really think building with Hugo is the best option. I&amp;rsquo;m going to guide you through building a blog in this series of posts. Lets start off with the most important question - why.
Hugo is a static site generator. Everyone is really jumping on the static+serverless/JAMStack hype train these days, and there are many good reasons for that.</description>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;re going to start from zero and arm you with the key points you&amp;rsquo;ll need to get started building a nice blog in Hugo. I wrote this site nearly from scratch from the base template on up but it was not a huge lift.
This guide assumes that you aren&amp;rsquo;t going to read any of the Hugo docs. I&amp;rsquo;m totally ok with that, I&amp;rsquo;ll link you to the parts that I&amp;rsquo;d otherwise repeat.</description>
