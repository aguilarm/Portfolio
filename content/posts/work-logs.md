At any moment, I tend to have quite a few things that need my attention in some way. I've found that I'll need to 
context switch several times during the day - from answering a question to attending a meeting or checking in
on a long-running process.

Jumping in and out of contexts can be pretty difficult and will really cost a lot of time.

In an effort to be as available as possible for the occasional interruption without spending a ton of time getting
back into whatever I'm working on, I've been using timestamped work logs. I've found it helpful for quite a few 
different reasons that I'll outline later.

## Method

Every time I come up with a new immediate goal - usually once or twice an hour - I write it out in a notebook
after the current time. I use a small moleskin to keep each line relatively short.

Some examples:

- **1215** The image element should be null. If the image is null, you cannot save.
- **1251** It is definitely the space in the image causing problems, loading spinner fixed.
- **155** The ckeditor is conflicting. Ckeditor is on the page twice.
- **220** Make renderer for files plugin. It needs to be backwards compatible.

So, definitely a brain-dump sort of stream of consciousness thing. I use them to set
way-points throughout my day that I can go back to in order to figure out where I was and how I got there, quickly. 
Most of the time, I'll jot one of these down before I hop on a call or something so I can get right back to
what I was doing. Just having that small note makes a big difference - coming back to an open code editor and
little else hours later is a bit daunting.

## Results

I've been writing logs like this for a little over a year now, and it's been a huge help for a couple of reasons:

1. With very little effort, I've got something to refer to when I need to log hours.
2. Further, I am hyper aware of the passage of time and my estimates are *way* more accurate. 
3. The act of writing something out - even just figuring out *what* to write - helps me focus and keep things in perspective.

Most of us likely have a notepad handy. Writing down your problem or a solution you've come up with is
incredibly helpful. I think augmenting your note taking with a work log is huge. Let me know if you do something
like this!
