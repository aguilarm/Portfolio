Throughout my career, I've made it a point to have a varied experience. 
I believe _every_ stack can offer valuable insights into problem-solving with software.

The incredible amount of excellent resources available to our industry is 
 constantly inspiring, and I spend a lot of time [reading new books](/posts/bookshelf/) and [watching conference talks](/posts/talks-i-love/).

Simple and elegant solutions really get me excited. This site is primarily built on [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) and I'm really hyped for things like [Svelte](svelte.dev). 
The [JAMStack](https://jamstack.org/) and the things companies like [Vercel](https://vercel.com/about) are up to are moving writing software for the web in an excellent direction.

As I've become more comfortable in my technical abilities I've started moving increasingly towards mentoring others.

Here are a few of the technologies I've worked with:

#### Frameworks & Libraries

I've built software on the foundations of things like [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/), [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/), [Golang](https://golang.org/), [C#/.NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/), and [Drupal 8](https://www.drupal.org/).

#### Tooling

To get projects up to prod, I've used [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/), [Google Cloud Build](https://cloud.google.com/cloud-build/) and [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/).
To debug, I've looked to tools such as [Grafana](https://grafana.com/), [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/), [DataDog](https://datadoghq.com), [WeaveWorks](https://weave.works) and [Blackfire](https://blackfire.io).

#### Services

Production workloads I've managed have included systems such as [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/), [Redis](https://redis.io/), [Varnish](https://varnish-cache.org/), [Apache Solr](https://lucene.apache.org/solr/), [PHP](https://www.php.net), [Socket.io](https://socket.io) and many more.

#### Platforms

Most recently, I've been doing all of this on [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/) but I've been deep in [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) and have used [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/) for many a personal project. I would really love to be using some
sort of serverless + static files driven solution for future projects.

With this site I hope to share insights I've collected along the way with you. Thanks for stopping by.
