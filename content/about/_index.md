Throughout my career, I've made it a point to have a varied experience. I believe _every_ stack can offer valuable insights into problem solving with software.

Simple and elegant solutions really get me excited. This site is primarily built on [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) and I'm really hyped for things like [Svelte](svelte.dev). The [JAMStack](https://jamstack.org/) and the things companies like [Zeit](https://zeit.co/about) are up to are moving writing software for the web in an excellent direction.

As I've become more comfortable in my technical abilities I've started moving increasingly towards mentoring others.

#### Frameworks & Libraries

I've built software on the foundations of things like [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/), [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/), [Golang](https://golang.org/), [C#/.NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/), and [Drupal 8](https://www.drupal.org/).

#### Tooling

To get projects up to prod, I've used [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/), [Google Cloud Build](https://cloud.google.com/cloud-build/) and [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/).
To debug, I've looked to tools such as [Grafana](https://grafana.com/), [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/), [DataDog](https://datadoghq.com), [WeaveWorks](https://weave.works) and [Blackfire](https://blackfire.io).

#### Services

Production workloads I've managed have included systems such as [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/), [Redis](https://redis.io/), [Varnish](https://varnish-cache.org/), [Apache Solr](https://lucene.apache.org/solr/), [PHP](https://www.php.net), [Socket.io](https://socket.io) and many more.

#### Platforms

Most recently, I've been doing all of this on [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/) but I've been deep in [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) and have used [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/) for many a personal project. I would really love to be using some
sort of serverless + static files driven solution for future projects.

With this site I hope to share insights I've collected along the way with you. Thanks for stopping by.
