In doing the research that lead to [my post about decoupled Drupal](/posts/building-decoupled-drupal-sites-2019), I created a boilerplate project for using Gatsby with Drupal. The project is pretty basic but should have everything you need to get started. It uses docker-compose so you can run it anywhere you have docker installed.
