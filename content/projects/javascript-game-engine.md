description: "Project from a Udacity course."

Long ago, I found [Udacity's cs255 course](https://eu.udacity.com/course/html5-game-development--cs255) on building a game engine almost from scratch in JavaScript and had a go at it.

Everything except the physics engine is built with mostly vanilla javascript and minimal libraries. I did a fair bit of adjusting and fixing the engine to get it to work, which ended up being quite a bit of sort of reverse engineering because the course was mostly abandoned and the original game only sort of worked when I took the class.

The art here is not my own, I used a few different libraries from [OpenGameArt](https://opengameart.org/). The github repo has specifics on those.

This project really catapulted my understanding of all kinds of things but probably the most important insight was how the game loop worked.
