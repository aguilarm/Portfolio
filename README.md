What's Here
=========

This is my personal website and play area.  Right now, it's set up as a node application with routes and styling ready for my blog angular app in dev, but I'm working on proper authentification before I make it live.

Most of this stuff is probably the cutting edge of my learning progress, or likely was when I wrote it, so there is a lot of potential for facepalming.  As I continue to grow as a developer I do my best to update all of the things here and make it a really solid base project.
