    	<p>My name is Mika Aguilar, and I've been tinkering with computers since my parents bought our first one around 1998.  I still have a 'Programming for Dummies' book and some notebooks filled with notes from way back then that I used to teach myself how to write BASIC when I was around 14.  I've always been fascinated by the seemingly endless potential technology brings to our lives, as well as a bit of a freak for organizing things nicely.  Both traits translate well into developing applications for the web, and the field really excites me.</p>
    	<p>With the internet, building cross-platform applications that can enrich people's lives is the coolest thing ever.  I've come a long way since I was a kid, and still have a long way to go.  Right now I can write in php, java, C++, C#, javascript, jQuery, mySQL, html, and css.</p>
    	<p>I'm currently enrolled in classes at GRCC and living in Grand Rapids, Michigan with one more semester until I have an Associates in Web Design/Development.  After that I'm planning on moving to Austin, TX to be with family and get a kickstart on my career.</p>
